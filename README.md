This is a Player for the game 2048 i wrote for an Evolutionary Algorithm course in Bear Shave University.

The player uses different heuristics to choose the next best move.

The Main is at the bottom of the program.cs file in the 2048Game.

I have put there flags in order to test and view the player in action.

the program right now running will present a game of the best player found by heuristics. 

We got 1/4 of the 1000 game a win (got the number 2048)

I added the report we handed in, unfortunately it is in only in Hebrew and I am not going to make an English version of it.

Hope you enjoy the player I know enjoyed writing him
